# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Response Boxes will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.2] - 2026-01-30

### Changed

- **Repository hygiene:** Refresh README, support + security guidance, and GitHub
  templates to align with the `agent-response-boxes` rename and the shipped
  `outputs/` install model
- **Docs accuracy:** Update cross-agent compatibility docs for Cursor 2.4+ skills
  and Windsurf skills support

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Tier A parity:** Fix Windsurf + Cursor collectors to correctly extract box
  fields from the canonical `**Field:** value` format (and still accept
  `**Field**: value`), so `BoxCreated.fields` is consistent across agents
  (improves cross-session learning projections)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-30

### Changed

- **Rename (pending GitHub rename):** `claude-response-boxes` → `agent-response-boxes`
- **Build-time outputs:** Added `bin/cace-build` to generate a committed `outputs/`
  tree using CACE (install no longer depends on `agents/` layout)
- **Installer sources from `outputs/`:** Installer now fetches and installs from
  the committed `outputs/` tree, with a temporary raw URL fallback during the
  repo rename window
- **Cursor rules quality:** Added `.mdc` frontmatter and explicit “always follow”
  instruction; validated with CACE against Cursor v2.4 rules expectations

### Fixed

- **OpenCode plugin parsing:** Prevent false header matches caused by newline
  whitespace and support both `**Field:** value` and `**Field**: value` formats
- **CACE validation noise:** Converted `allowed-tools` to a proper YAML list in
  `analyze-boxes` skills
- **Installer basic-mode summary:** No longer lists hooks/skills/analytics as installed

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-25

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed 🪞 Sycophancy box** — Anti-sycophancy is now a sophisticated
  internal protocol based on research (ELEPHANT framework, SMART, self-blinding
  studies). It operates during response generation without visible output.

### Added

- `agents/claude-code/rules/anti-sycophancy.md` — Research-backed protocol with:
  - Five dimensions of sycophancy detection (ELEPHANT framework)
  - System 2 self-interrogation stages
  - Third-person perspective technique (63.8% efficacy)
  - Counterfactual checking
  - Banned phrases with replacements
  - Integration guidance with existing response boxes

### Changed

- Box count reduced from 13 to 12
- Existing Sycophancy boxes preserved in event store but filtered from context
  injection

### Research References

- [Towards Understanding Sycophancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548)
- [ELEPHANT Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13995v2)
- [Self-Blinding Research](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.14553)
- [SMART Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.16742v1)

### Migration

No action required. Sycophancy boxes will no longer appear in responses.
Historical Sycophancy boxes remain in the event store but are not projected.

- Cursor enhanced basic mode with collection hook and manual context skill
- OpenCode native skill distribution and static instructions
- Comprehensive cross-agent compatibility documentation
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting and data handling guidelines

- Cross-session learning with recency decay
- Support for learning hierarchy (meta-learnings)

### Changed

- Boxes stored as JSONL events instead of JSON array
- Learnings now synthesized from evidence with confidence tracking

### Changed

- Simplified installation to focus on rules and output styles
- Moved agent-specific files to `agents/` directory

### Removed

- Hard dependency on Claude Code hooks for basic mode

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- User/project installation scopes
- `--project` flag for project-level installation
- `--uninstall` flag for removing components
- Backup mechanism for modified files

### Changed

- Default installation scope is now user-level (`~/.claude/`)
- Installer detects and reports existing installation status

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-19

  Pushback, Suggestion, Reflection, FollowUps, Completion, Quality, Sycophancy)
- Output style (`response-box.md`)
